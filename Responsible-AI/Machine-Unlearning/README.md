# Machine Unlearning
This project demonstrates unlearning in neural networks by selectively removing data and retraining models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `dataset/` â†’ Placeholder for dataset files.
- `notebook/` â†’ Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- `results/` â†’ Stores plots and saved models.

## ðŸš€ Steps
1. Train a CNN on MNIST.
2. Remove a specific class.
3. Retrain and compare accuracy.
